JOneTouch
=========

You need to restart your apache server, to execute a script or to check a log file ?

`JOneTouch` allows to program all these actions. Add your `sh` scripts and easily execute them.

1. Save all the `ssh` connections of your servers.
2. Create your administration scripts.
3. Choose `ssh` connections by default for which your actions will be executed.

Do not be afraid for your scripts, the application is protected by a password! And for more security all provided passwords are encrypted.

A 2x1 widget allows you to execute and modify an action even faster.

To save or share your work, `JOneTouch` allows you to export your `ssh` connections and actions through the application of your choice.
